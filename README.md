The project aims to investigate the proportion and characteristics of paid reviews on a HK-based restaurant review platform -- OpenRice. 

After scrapping using Selenium, a dataframe containing 47515 comments from 1027 users are created. The demographics of the distribution of the users, and the most frequently appearing words are visualized.

We hypothesized that paid reviewers tends to have 
1)higher comment frequency, 
2)higher average rating and 
3)higher no. of images per comment. 
To include the shadow accounts, accounts with only one no. of comment but also satisfy condition 2) and 3) are also considered as paid revieweres.

It is discovered that users with level 4 tends to have higher rating, and their comments are highly repeated with certain vocabularies or clauses. We performed two-sample Z-test and found that the scoring of the suspicious subgroup that we identified has a statistically significantly higher score than the other group.

We draw the conclusion that the group with account level equals to 4 is the most suspicious subgroup to be paid reviewers.
